"""Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the
elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, 
make a new list that has all the elements less
than 5 from this list in it and print out this
new list.
2. Ask the user for a number and return a list
that contains only elements from the original list
a that are smaller than the number given by the user"""
