""" Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the
number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message 
to the user.
Extras:
1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different 
message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num)
and one number to divide by(check). If check divides evenly into 
num, tell that to the user.
If not, print a different appropriate message."""
