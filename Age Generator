"""Create a program that asks the user to enter their name
and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that 
tells them the year they will turn 100 years old.
Extras:
1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for
another number and printing out that many copies of the 
previous message.
2. Print out that many copies of the previous message 
on separate lines."""
