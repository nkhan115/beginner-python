"""List Overlap:
Take two lists, say for example these two:
a = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
b = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains
only the elements that are common between the lists
(without duplicates). Make sure your program works on
two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
1.Randomly generate two lists to test this.
2.Write this in one line of python
"""
from random import randint
a=[]
b=[]
num_a=randint(4,12)#program decides how many numbers in each list
num_b=randint(4,12)
for c in range(0,num_a):
    a.append(randint(0,30))
for d in range(0,num_b):
    b.append(randint(0,30))
print a
print b
#we just created two random lists
same_list=[]
